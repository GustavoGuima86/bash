# Terraform Project Template Generator

Manually setting up a Terraform project structure every time can be tedious. To save time and effort, this script automates the process of creating a ready-to-use Terraform project structure.

As the saying goes:  
*"If you can automate something in 2 hours that would otherwise take 30 minutes a year, do it."*  
(sarcasm mode: on).
